Welcome to BUGHACK.

The idea for the game was to include roguelike mechanics based on how ants find food through scents. 

You are a leader ant who must lead worker ants to delicious harvest. Every sector you must gather a certain amount of harvest. Keep your ants safe, or you'll take damage! You must call ants out of an ant hole and then lead them to to fruit.
